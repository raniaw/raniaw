                     is the capital and largest city of both England 
                     and the United Kingdom.[9][10] Standing 
                     on the River Thames in the south-east of 
                     England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) 
                     estuary leading to the North Sea, London has 
                     been a major settlement for two millennia. 
                     Londinium was founded by the Romans.
                      The City of London, London's ancient 
                      core − an area of just 1.12 square miles 
                      (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the
                       Square Mile − retains boundaries that
                        follow closely its medieval limits.
                        The City of Westminster is also an Inner 
                        London borough holding city status. 
                        reater London is governed by the Mayor
                         of London and the London Assembly.[17][note 2][18]
